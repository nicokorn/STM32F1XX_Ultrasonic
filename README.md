# STM32F1XX_Ultrasonic
Small fun project done on a booring afternoon. I had a Ultrasonic transceiver board, blue pill board and a touchbutton laying around, so I decided to do a ultrasonic meter. The source code is done in baremetal and is doing only the minimum of doing a distance mesaurement by touching the the touchbutton. Feel free to use the code for your projects.
